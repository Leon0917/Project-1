Ideas for project

This is fun

This is weird

I like the idea of using Nextflix API

Something about restaurants 
Something about recipes
Food additives?
Grocery list for ingredients

Meal Planner:
User chooses recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner
Meal planner calculates macros
Google Maps directs you to the nearest grocery stores
(Or possibly change Google Maps API?)


Planned APIs:
